      // Don’t use arrow functions on an options property or callback,
      // such as created: () => console.log(this.a) or vm.$watch('a', newValue => this.myMethod())

      // Called synchronously after the instance is created.
      // At this stage, the instance has finished processing the options which means

      // If the root instance is mounted to an in-document element,
      // vm.$el will also be in-document when mounted is called.

      // Note that mounted does not guarantee that all child components have also been mounted.

      // Called when data changes, before the DOM is patched.
      // This is a good place to access the existing DOM before an update,
      // e.g. to remove manually added event listeners.
      beforeUpdate: function() {

      // Called after a data change causes the virtual DOM to be re-rendered and patched. Eg: Change data values
      // The component’s DOM will have been updated when this hook is called,
      // so you can perform DOM-dependent operations here.
      // However, in most cases you should avoid changing state inside the hook.
      // To react to state changes, it’s usually better to use a computed property or watcher instead.

      // Note that updated does not guarantee that all child components have also been re-rendered.
