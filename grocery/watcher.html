      Watcher can be very useful when you want to perform asynchronous or expensive operations
      in response to changing data.
    </h2>

    <div class="watch-example">
      <p>Ask a yes/no question: <input v-model="question" /></p>
      <p>{{ answer }}</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Since there is already a rich ecosystem of ajax libraries    -->
  <!-- and collections of general-purpose utility methods, Vue core -->
  <!-- is able to remain small by not reinventing them. This also   -->
  <!-- gives you the freedom to use what you're familiar with.      -->
